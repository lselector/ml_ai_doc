OCR and data extraction from documents.
=========================

You can use various OCR tools from Python.
Which one to choose depends on specific requirements.
For example, is it printed or hand-written ?
Is it OK to using Amazon or Google APIs ?
There are multiple libraries.
The most common go-to library is tesseract OCR.

There is always a trade off between quality, quantity, price, privacy requirements.
