Gosh, Just Make a Power Point to Convert Chaos into Vision.

Development of science, ML & AI is changing our lives.
We see chaos of new technologies, new approaches, new promises.
What worked 5 years ago will surely not applicable in 5 years from now.

We need to make changes to survive in this new world.
We need to try to forecast the future.
And to make new plans, learn new skills.
We need to build strategic bridges through this chaos.

Nobody knows the right answer as things change.
It is difficult to predict what will be important, and what will not.

We come up with some plan.
Not a perfect plan. :(
But something is better than nothing.

We need to periodically re-think our priorities.
To re-think ourselves.
To stop defining ourselves by our past.
And start pulling ourselves towards the vision of the future.

Making decisions requires bravery.
Nobody can tell you what is the right thing to do.

You try to find words to describe what you see.
You try to find relationships between events, to find patterns,
to extract useful strategies.

Gosh, just make a Power Point.
Convert chaos into some structure.
Create a vision.
And then work on improving this vision as you go along.
