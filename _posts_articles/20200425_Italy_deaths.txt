Why there were so many deaths in Italy?

Question - why there were so many deaths in
Italy?

Answer: The death rate from coronavirus in Italy
is actually same as in other countries. The
difference is that in Italy the lockdown was done
late, more than two weeks after first deaths were
reported, which allowed the infection to spread
very fast.

Feb21:      21 cases,      1 death
Mar01:   1,701 cases,     41 deaths
Mar09:   9,172 cases,    463 deaths, LOCKDOWN order
Mar31: 105,792 cases, 12,428 deaths
Apr24: 192,994 cases, 25,969 deaths

So they have waited for more than two weeks to
implement the lockdown (from February 21st until
March 9th).

Compare this with fast reaction in San Francisco.
London Breed, the Mayor of San Francisco, has
issued a "stay-at-home" order when there were no
deaths yet. San Francisco has become the first
city in US to do that. 

Compare today's numbers of two cities:

 San Francisco :   22 deaths
 New York City : 11,544 deaths

Anyway, returning to Italy, here are today's
numbers: Population : 60M, Cases: 0.2M, Deaths:
26K.

If infections = 15% of population, we have ~10M
infections, so the death rate:  26K / 10M =
0.0026 = 0.26% .

This number is similar to rates we were
estimating for other countries. The rate may be
even smaller if the actual spread of the
infection in Italy is more than 15%. Italy just
started series of tests to determine the actual
number of infected in northern region of
Lombardy. So hopefully we will have more accurate
estimates in a couple of weeks.
