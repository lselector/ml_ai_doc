Today's post is about Tom Siebel and his companies.
Tom Siebel was employee #20 at Oracle,
then in 1993 he started his own company “Siebel Systems”,
which he sold back to Oracle in 2016 for $5.85 Bln.
Then in 2009 he started “C3 Energy”.
Name "C3" comes from "Carbon-3", 
where 3 comes from Measure-Mitigate-Monetize.

Tom has restructured his company in 2011 
into “C3 IoT” (Internet of Things),

and in 2016 into C3.ai. 

Today C3.ai is evaluated at $2+ Bln - and growing fast.

In his last book “Digital Transformation" he writes 
that AI and related technologies are disruptive,
a life extinction event for corporations (similar to ice 
age for dinosaurs). He states that since 2000, 52 percent 
of Fortune 500 companies have fallen off the list. 

So in order to survive, organizations must undergo digital 
transformation by using elastic cloud computing, big data, 
artificial intelligence, and internet of things. 

The book provides a 10-point CEO action plan.
