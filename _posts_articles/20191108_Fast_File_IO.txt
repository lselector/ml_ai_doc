Faster Data Files I/O.

In Data Science and Analytics we routinely need to save 
and load big chunks of data. i
Question â€“ which file format should we use?
Saving/Loading CSV files is very-very slow. 
Here us a short comparison between CSV, pickle, and feather formats:

Result: pickle and feather file formats are ~40 times faster i than CSV ! 

I prefer pickle, because it allows me to save a "bag" object 
(basically a dictionary) containing several DataFrames and parameters.

Eventually we will probably switch to Apache Arrow:

Here is a comparison of six file formats i
(CSV, Pickle, MessagePack, HDF5, Feather, Parquet):
