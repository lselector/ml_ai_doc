AI will Lead to Global Centralization.

Step1: Phone + Internet.

Development of communication technologies
(phone, fax, internet)
has led to the rise of huge companies
with billions of users, such as Facebook,
Google (Alphabet), Instagram, Apple,
Microsoft, Amazon, Linkedin, etc.

Companies are becoming bigger than governments.
For example, Amazon has ~800,000 employees.

Number of customers becomes bigger than the
largest countries. For example, Facebook has
2.5 Billion monthly active users.

Step2: AI.

Development of AI technologies gives huge
advantages to few big companies because
they can collect and process more data,
and can create better models allowing
to make better decisions. They can coordinate
actions dynamically around the globe much
better and faster than governments can.

As a result we should see more
centralization of economical (and AI) power
in hands of just few global companies.
