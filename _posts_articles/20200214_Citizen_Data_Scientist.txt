Most of the Businesses Choose Citizen Data
Scientist Approach.

Citizen Data Scientist (CDS) - a term coined in
2016 by Joao Tapadinhas, Carlie Idoine from
Gartner research:

The basic idea is to make advanced analytics
accessible to a wider audience by using better
tools.

Companies like DataRobot use this idea as their
main marketing statement. They say that you canâ€™t
possibly hire all the Data Scientists you need,
but you can buy tools which will allow business
users to do Data Science themselves.

I can definitely attest to the fact that although
most of the businesses claim that they want to do
Machine Learning, in reality they just want tools
to do analytics dashboards (think Tableau). They
can appreciate of-the-shelf tools for data
visualization, cleaning, preparation, loading
(ETL). They can use some simple models (Linear
Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
etc.). But they will most probably reject the
idea of building custom Machine Learning
solutions.
