If you are a Data Scientist, you must have heard about H2O.ai.
This company was developing Machine Learning tools since 2011. 
These tools are used by ~250,000 users and ~18,000 companies 
around the world.

Yesterday, October 22nd, I have attended H2OWORLD - a big

Another announcements was that Driverless AI
