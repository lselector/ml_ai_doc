How to Become a Data Architect (DA)

Salary: 135K+ for 4+ years of experience

Data Architecture = models, policies, rules, standadrds that govern
  data collection, processing, storage, and usage.

Data Architect (DA) designs a data system from scratch.
How data is loaded, stored, maintained, queried, and consumed.
DA draws diagrams - how data is connected, flows through states, etc.
to allow automation, self-service reporting, data-led decisions.
DA designs all stages and plans for execution: 
    Designing, Creating, Deploying, Managing.
