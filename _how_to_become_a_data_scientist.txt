Below are general recommendations about 
becoming a Data Scientist (DS) or Machine Learning (ML) Engineer.

=================================================
1.
Data Science (DS) uses some math - but you don't need to learn it.

Think about it this way.

To drive a car you need to pass some driving lessons.
You don't need to know how to build a car.
You just need to know how to drive it.

In ML you need to know some standard ML models, how to use
them, how to select the best one, how to evaluate its
quality, etc.

=================================================
2.
There are probably ~ 100-200 terms commonly used in DS & ML. 
Here are most of them in one text file (a dictionary).
You can learn them by looking them up on YouTube, Wikipedia, etc.:
  - https://github.com/lselector/ml_ai_doc/blob/master/_dict_ML_AI.txt

So, google the terms, memorize them.
I someone asks you what is :
    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes,
    Random Forest
    XGBoost
    TF-IDF
    KNN
    SVM
    etc.
you should know the answer right away.


And here are some math terms (no need to learn them):
  - https://github.com/lselector/ml_ai_doc/blob/master/_dict_Math.txt

So if you look up 5-10 terms/day - then you can learn all DS
terminology in ~ 1 month.

Remember the rule: to retain information you have to
repeat terms for 2 weeks. So each day you learn new terms
and repeat terms studied over the previous 2 weeks.

=================================================
3.
You need to learn constantly. 
Taking one-time course doesn't solvew the problem.

Data Science changes very fast.
The methods we are using today didn't exist 4-5 years ago.

You need to learn constantly.
You need to set-up routines / habits which will 
inform/educate you automatically.
For example, you can subscribe to newsletters and podcasts,
follow certain people on social media, etc.

There are many online resources.
The main resource is youtube.
Think about youtube as a university.
As a professor which can teach you.
As a teacher assistant which can asnwer your questions.

So - get yourself a Youtube Prime subscription 
($12..$18/mo) to be able to download training videos
on your phone and watch them without annoying ads.

=================================================
4.
Almost all data science happens on Unix (Linux or Mac).

New Mac - 16" MacBook Pro with 64GB RAM and 1TB SSD.

Used Mac - 15" mid-2015 MacBook Pro
           Specific model (!!) MJLT2LL/A
           Current eBay prices are ~ $900.
           2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 Processor, 
           16GB RAM
           512GB SSD (fast PCIe 2.0 x4 interface)
           Dual graphics:
               Radeon R9 M370X
               built-inIntel Iris Pro 5200

Alternatively if you don't like Mac, there are
many other options, for example:

Lambda Labs TensorBook (with Linux):
  https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook/max/customize

Dell Precision 5540 (with Ubuntu Linux):
  https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/precision-15-5540-laptop
  https://wesmckinney.com/blog/linux-laptop-experience/

=================================================
5.
Python has become THE language of Data Science.
Everybody uses Anaconda python distribution.

The main dev. environment is JupyterLab:
  https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Also you need a simple text editor, for example:
  https://www.sublimetext.com/

Look on youtube for online tutorials for:

    python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

for example:

Python Programming - tutorial by Derek Banas:
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA

Python Pandas Data Science Tutorial by Keith Galli:
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg

Python NumPy Tutorial by Edureka:
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JfDAm9y_7s

Scikit-Learn Tutorial by Simplilearn:
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt9w-BxKFQ

Note - I just spent 5 min to find those links.
You may find better tutorials (may be) if you search yourself.

=================================================
6.
You need to know some statistics.
Normal distribution & CLT (Central Limit Theorem), etc.
There are many tutorials online (youtube).

For example, from Justin Zeltzer (channel "zedstatistics"):
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyjlxsLW1Is 
  - http://www.zstatistics.com/justinsfavourites

You also need to be familiar with Excel
  (vlookup, pivot table, etc.)
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WAEzokHSJM
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-AK0Hv0b4

Also SQL (Structured Query Language):
  - http://www.sqlcourse.com/
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pzj7Aj25lw

=================================================
7.
Data Science has become a huge field.
Nobody can know everything.
But it is important to know the main people,
main milestones, main concepts.
Start following some famous people on youtube, 
facebook, twitter:

    Yann LeCun
    Geoffrey Hinton
    Ian Goodfellow
    Yoshua Bengio
    Jürgen Schmidhuber
    Andrew Ng
    etc.

Listen to these lectures:

  Andrew Ng at Amazon re:MARS 2019
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2nGxw8sKYU

  C3.ai - Thomas Siebel on Digital Transformation
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ie4gat6idQ

=================================================
8. 
There is a great podcast which I recommend to 
listen to regularly:
   Sam Charrington – “This Week in Machine Learning & AI”

=================================================
9. 
Siraj Raval on youtube
It is a great learning source.

I know that he used other people materials
without giving credit (plagiarized).
He has apologized - and hopefully will never do it again. 
His videos are very good.

11.
Listen to my old lectures on youtube - here are the first 4:

   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iGVdjw34iI
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0qtk09Lw4
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPdrXQZy3ok
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJhGmWlHbRw

=================================================
12.
You should also know terms related to training 
the models and evaluating the quality of the models

    error / loss function
    regularization
    cross-validation, folds
    Precision and Recall
    Accuracy
    ROC curve
    confusion matrix
    etc.

They are part of my dictionary:
  - https://github.com/lselector/ml_ai_doc/blob/master/_dict_ML_AI.txt

=================================================
13.
For Deep Leaning (CNNs, RNNs, etc.) I recommend
to take this coursera course: 

    deeplearning.ai

But this only is after you have learned the basic 
Machine Learning.

=================================================
14.
Look at AutoML:
